Here i have taken the Titanic dataset and predict the survival status of passengers.
Step 1
I had taken the data set and find the null values in data and fill it which is known as data preprocessing
Step 2
In Step 2 i had done feature engineering in the data by doing Regular expression and label hot encoder and convert it into numerical format.
Step 3
I select the features which highly significant and which affect more on predicted variable by seeing correlation b/w all features. This process is known as Feature Selection.
Step 4
I created the various model like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest Classifer and Decison Tree and checked the accuracy of it. Decison Tree gave the best score.
